django-simple-wiki
=================

This is a simple wiki app forked from http://django-simple-wiki.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

This will be updated for Django 1.4, with back support for Django 1.3 (if there is no need for 1.4 code) or if there is enough demand. 

I will continue to use Markdown as the syntax but will attempt to abstract this from the code and leave it open to the user (potentially end-user)

Will include support for attachments, in-line images and diffs between revisions.
